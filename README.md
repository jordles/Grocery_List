## Grocery List (OOP)  

This assignment focused on OOP practices. We made a grocery list that you can add items to and edit dynamically. Items are saved using Local Storage. 

# How its Made

Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

# Lessons Learned

We learned a lot about Local Storage. We didn't realize that it was parsed as a string in values. So we utilized JSON.parse (converts the strings back to our datatype) and JSON.stringify (converting our other datatypes to strings). We also used new event listeners like blur() when interacting with the focused state. What was challenging was implementing the proper logic for editing our list items live, but contenteditable property came in handy.
